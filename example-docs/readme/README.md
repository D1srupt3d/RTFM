# Example Documentation

This folder contains example documentation that demonstrates RTFM's features.

## Files

- `index.md` - Welcome page with quick start guide
- `syntax-test.md` - Comprehensive syntax highlighting showcase (16+ languages)

## Usage

### For Development

When developing RTFM without a DOCS_REPO configured, the server will use this example content to demonstrate features.

### For Users

Users can reference these files as templates for their own documentation structure.

### As a Test Page

The syntax-test.md serves as a visual test to ensure all themes and syntax highlighting work correctly across different languages.

## Adding More Examples

Feel free to add more example pages here that showcase RTFM capabilities:
- Complex table layouts
- Nested navigation structures  
- Image handling
- Different markdown features
